In short: **Cyber Security is crucial for safeguarding information, enabling trust, and ensuring smooth, secure operations** in our increasingly digital society.

### Quick Recall Tip

Remember the “CIA Triad” — **Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability** — to quickly recall the core goals of cyber security. Can you briefly explain why each part matters?

## <mark> 2) List and explain the challenges in implementing Cyber Security. </mark>

### Challenges in Implementing Cyber Security

Let's break down key challenges organizations face:

### 1. **Sophistication of Cyber Attacks**

Attackers constantly upgrade their tactics, using complex methods like Advanced Persistent Threats and ransomware that can evade detection for long periods and cause severe harm. Modern attacks often involve multi-stage strategies and target critical operations.

### 2. **Human Error**

People are often the weakest link—poor password management, falling for phishing, or carelessly sharing sensitive data make systems vulnerable. Training helps, but mistakes still happen frequently.

### 3. **Rapidly Evolving Technology**

Emerging technologies (like IoT and cloud computing) expand the attack surface. Many new devices lack built-in security, making them easy targets, while cloud services bring unique vulnerabilities such as misconfigured storage.

### 4. **Third-Party and Supply Chain Risks**

Organizations rely on external vendors, partners, or open-source software. If these have weak security, one breach can cascade through many connected networks, impacting multiple companies.

### 5. **Shortage of Skilled Professionals**

There's a global gap in cybersecurity expertise. Without enough trained personnel, organizations struggle to detect, respond to, and recover from sophisticated attacks.

### 6. **Legacy and Edge Devices**

Old systems and new "edge" devices often aren't built for modern security needs. Legacy software may lack updates, and edge devices create additional vulnerable points that are hard to monitor.

### Summing Up

Cyber security is tough to implement because attacks are getting smarter, technology and devices keep changing, people make mistakes, supply chains are complex, and skilled experts are in short supply. Focusing on **training, technology upgrades, vendor assessments, and recruiting skilled teams** helps mitigate these risks.

Examples clearly distinguish the two: common cyber threats include malware and phishing attacks, whereas cyberwarfare includes sophisticated operations like Stuxnet and politically motivated state attacks impacting countries on a large scale.

## <mark> 5) Explain the CIA Triad with neat diagram and examples. </mark>

![1-5.png](./1-5.png)

### CIA Triad Explanation with Examples

The CIA Triad stands for **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability**—the three foundational principles of cybersecurity that aim to protect information and systems.

### 1. Confidentiality

- **Definition:** Ensures that sensitive information is accessible only to authorized users and prevents unauthorized access or disclosure.
- **Example:** Using strong passwords, multi-factor authentication (like a code sent to a phone), and encryption (e.g., HTTPS for websites) to protect user data from hackers.

### 2. Integrity

- **Definition:** Maintains the accuracy, consistency, and trustworthiness of data by preventing unauthorized modification or tampering.
- **Example:** Digital signatures and hashing ensure that financial transaction records or software updates haven’t been altered during transmission or storage.

### 3. Availability

- **Definition:** Guarantees that information and resources are available and accessible to authorized users whenever needed.
- **Example:** Using backup systems, load balancing, and defense against DDoS attacks to ensure that an e-commerce website remains accessible during high traffic or cyberattacks.

Together, the CIA Triad provides a balanced security approach ensuring data stays private (Confidentiality), reliable (Integrity), and accessible (Availability) for users and organizations.

## <mark> 6) What is Cyber Terrorism? Give suitable examples. </mark>

### Cyber Terrorism Definition

Cyber Terrorism refers to **the use of the internet and digital technology by terrorist groups or individuals to carry out violent acts** that cause or threaten loss of life, significant damage, or disruption with the aim of achieving political, religious, or ideological objectives. These acts involve attacks on computer systems, networks, or critical infrastructure to create fear, panic, or intimidation among populations or governments.

### Examples of Cyber Terrorism

- **Disruption of National Power Grids:** Attackers targeting power infrastructure to cause widespread blackouts, paralyzing cities or countries.
- **Ransomware Attacks on Critical Infrastructure:** Holding a hospital’s or government’s systems hostage to extort money or exert political pressure.
- **Website Defacement or Propaganda:** Terrorist groups hacking websites to spread extremist messages or misinformation.
- **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:** Overwhelming government or emergency services websites to hinder communication and response.
- **Stuxnet Attack (Though often considered cyberwarfare):** A sophisticated malware targeting Iran's nuclear facilities, causing physical disruption.

Cyber terrorism differs from general cybercrime because it aims to **cause terror and influence political or social outcomes**, often threatening safety and security on a broader scale.

## <mark> 7) Explain the importance of Cyber Security for Critical Infrastructure (like power grids, transport, banking, etc.). </mark>

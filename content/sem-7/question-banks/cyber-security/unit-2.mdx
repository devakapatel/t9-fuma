## <mark> 1) Define Vulnerability Scanning. Why is it required? </mark>

### Vulnerability Scanning: Definition and Importance

**Definition:**
Vulnerability scanning is the process of automatically detecting, analyzing, and reporting security weaknesses (or vulnerabilities) in computer systems, networks, and software. Specialized scanning tools compare the configurations and assets in your digital environment with databases of known vulnerabilities to highlight potential risks and entry points for attackers.

**Why is Vulnerability Scanning Required?**

- **Identifies Hidden Risks:** It helps organizations find out-of-date software, misconfigurations, and security gaps before cybercriminals can exploit them.
- **Prevents Attacks:** Scanning allows proactive risk management—addressing issues before they lead to data breaches or system compromise.
- **Supports Compliance:** Many regulations (like PCI DSS, GDPR) require regular vulnerability scans for data protection and legal compliance.
- **Continuous Security:** The threat landscape keeps changing, and regular scanning is needed to spot and mitigate new vulnerabilities in real time.
- **Cost Savings:** Early detection can prevent expensive breaches, saving money on recovery, legal penalties, and reputational damage.

**Summary:**
Vulnerability scanning is essential because it enables organizations to discover and fix weaknesses in their systems before attackers do, protecting data, maintaining compliance, and ensuring the safety of critical operations.

## <mark> 2) Differentiate between Open Port Identification and Banner/Version Check. </mark>

### Open Port Identification vs Banner/Version Check

Let's clearly differentiate the two concepts:

### **Open Port Identification**

- **Purpose:** To determine which ports on a networked device are accepting connections (i.e., are 'open').
- **How:** Tools like Nmap or Netstat send probes to all ports on a target machine and record those that respond, indicating that a service is listening and the port is open.
- **Outcome:** You get a list of open ports (e.g., 22, 80, 443), but not the details of what software is running.
- **Example:** Finding that port 80 is open suggests a web server is running, but you don't know which software or its version.

### **Banner/Version Check**

- **Purpose:** To identify details about the service running behind each open port, such as its name, type, and version.
- **How:** After detecting an open port, tools send specific requests to elicit a response ("banner") from the service, which often contains identifying information (software type and version).
- **Outcome:** You learn both the software and its version (e.g., "Apache HTTPD/2.4.54" on port 80).
- **Example:** Performing a banner check on an open port 22 reveals "OpenSSH_8.2p1 Ubuntu-4ubuntu2", helping assess vulnerabilities specific to that software/version.

### **Summary Table**

| Activity                 | Purpose                      | Method                                  | Example Result  |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Open Port Identification | Find which ports are open    | Scanning all ports for responses        | Port 80 is open |
| Banner/Version Check     | Discover service and version | Sending protocol requests to open ports | "Apache/2.4.54" |

## <mark> 3) Explain the process of a Traffic Probe with example. </mark>

### Process of a Traffic Probe

A **traffic probe** is a tool used to collect and analyze network traffic data to monitor network health, performance, and detect anomalies or threats.

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Deployment:** Probes are installed on network nodes or devices, either as hardware or software modules. They can observe traffic directly at various points in the network.
2. **Packet Capture:** The probe listens to network traffic, capturing packets as they flow. This might include all types of data (web, email, VoIP, etc.).
3. **Data Extraction:** The probe extracts key details—like source/destination addresses, protocols, and payloads—needed for analysis.
4. **Analysis:** Probes analyze metrics such as bandwidth usage, latency, packet loss, and detect unusual patterns (potential security threats or performance issues).
5. **Threshold Comparison:** If captured data exceeds predefined thresholds (e.g., excessive latency or high bandwidth usage), the probe flags this for attention.
6. **Reporting/Alerting:** Results are sent to a central dashboard or monitoring tool. Alerts are triggered if suspicious activity or network problems are found.

### Example

Suppose a bank deploys a network probe on its main router. During working hours, the probe:

- Monitors real-time traffic patterns and records packet flows.
- Notices a sudden spike in outbound bandwidth and flags the activity.
- The probe's report helps the IT team quickly identify potential data exfiltration (maybe malware sending out confidential customer data), allowing them to act before major loss occurs.

### Why Use Probes?

Traffic probes help **prevent downtime, spot vulnerabilities, analyze performance, and maintain security** by giving administrators real-time visibility and early warning signals against threats or faults.

## <mark> 4) What are Vulnerability Probes? List common vulnerabilities with examples. </mark>

### What are Vulnerability Probes?

A **vulnerability probe** is a proactive cybersecurity technique used to systematically identify and assess security weaknesses (vulnerabilities) in computer systems, networks, or applications. Vulnerability probes interact directly with the target environment—such as by sending requests or packets—to discover security flaws or misconfigurations before attackers can exploit them. These probes often rely on automated scanning tools and known vulnerability databases (like CVE), and may include activities like port scanning, web application scanning, and configuration auditing. The main goal is to improve security posture by finding and addressing risks early.

### Why Vulnerability Probes Are Important

- **Proactive risk management:** Finds weaknesses before attackers do
- **Supports compliance:** Many regulations require regular scans
- **Prioritizes remediation:** Helps organizations focus on the most serious issues

### Common Vulnerabilities with Examples

Below are several regularly discovered vulnerabilities—each can be found via vulnerability probes:

- **Unpatched Software**
  - _Example:_ Missing security updates in operating systems or applications (e.g. Windows with outdated security patches), leaving it open to exploits like WannaCry ransomware.
- **Open Ports**
  - _Example:_ Unsecured ports like Telnet (port 23), which can allow unauthorized remote access if left exposed.
- **Weak or Default Passwords**
  - _Example:_ Admin panels secured with default "admin/admin" credentials.
- **SQL Injection**
  - _Example:_ Web applications vulnerable to users entering malicious SQL code, allowing data theft or manipulation.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
  - _Example:_ Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, stealing session data or credentials.
- **Misconfigured Firewalls/Servers**
  - _Example:_ Firewalls with unnecessary open ports, or servers with directory listing enabled that exposes sensitive files.
- **Outdated Encryption Protocols**
  - _Example:_ Use of insecure protocols like SSLv2 or weak ciphers, making data easier to intercept.

### Quick Recap

Vulnerability probes help organizations discover risks like software flaws, open ports, weak passwords, and insecure web apps. By regularly probing for these vulnerabilities, security teams dramatically reduce risks—and meet compliance requirements—by fixing issues before hackers exploit them.

## <mark> 8) Differentiate between Port Scanning and Network Reconnaissance. </mark>

### Port Scanning vs Network Reconnaissance

Let's break down the key differences:

### **Port Scanning**

- **Definition:** Port scanning is the process of actively probing a target system or device to discover which TCP or UDP ports are open, closed, or filtered.
- **Purpose:** It helps identify available network services running on a device (like web servers, SSH, DNS), revealing potential entry points or vulnerabilities that attackers or admins might target or secure.
- **Method:** Tools (such as Nmap, Netcat) send specific packets to a range of ports and analyze the responses. Each response tells you if the port is open (service listening), closed, or filtered by firewalls.
- **Example:** Scanning port 80 on a host and getting a response indicates a web server is running.

### **Network Reconnaissance**

- **Definition:** Network reconnaissance is a broader process of gathering information about a target network—mapping hosts, identifying devices, finding open ports and services, and collecting public data—with minimal to direct interaction.
- **Purpose:** It builds an overall picture of the network topology, operating systems, service versions, and potential weaknesses, often in preparation for more targeted attacks or assessments.
- **Method:** Involves both passive methods (like analyzing public data or traffic without interacting directly) and active methods (such as network mapping, ping sweeps, port scans, and OS fingerprinting). Port scanning is usually a **step within** network reconnaissance.
- **Example:** Discovering all active devices in a subnet, identifying a list of open ports and running services for each, as well as fingerprinting operating systems and collecting information from social media profiles.

### **Summary Table**

| Feature    | Port Scanning                                  | Network Reconnaissance                                    |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Focus      | Identifies open/closed/filtered ports          | Maps network, finds hosts, collects data                  |
| Technique  | Probes ports with packets, analyzes responses  | Uses port scans + host discovery + passive info gathering |
| Main Tools | Nmap, Netcat                                   | Nmap, ping sweeps, WHOIS, OSINT                           |
| Role       | Finds services/vulnerabilities on single hosts | Builds complete network picture                           |
| Scope      | Technical, service-focused                     | Strategic, broad network view                             |

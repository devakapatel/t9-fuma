### What is Data Cleaning?

Data cleaning, also known as data scrubbing, is the process of detecting and correcting (or removing) corrupt or inaccurate records from a dataset. The goal is to ensure that the data is consistent and free from errors, which is crucial for accurate analysis and decision-making. Data cleaning involves identifying and handling missing values, duplicate records, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset.

### Various Methods of Data Cleaning

1. **Handling Missing Values**
   - **Deletion**: Remove rows or columns with missing values. This is simple but can lead to loss of valuable data.
   - **Imputation**: Fill in missing values with estimated values. Common methods include:
     - **Mean/Median/Mode Imputation**: Replace missing values with the mean, median, or mode of the column.
     - **Predictive Imputation**: Use machine learning models to predict missing values based on other data.
     - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Imputation**: Replace missing values with the average of the K-nearest neighbors.

2. **Handling Duplicate Records**
   - **Detection**: Identify duplicate records using unique identifiers or by comparing multiple columns.
   - **Removal**: Delete duplicate records to ensure each entry is unique.

3. **Correcting Inconsistent Data**
   - **Standardization**: Ensure data is in a consistent format (e.g., dates, phone numbers, addresses).
   - **Normalization**: Scale data to a standard range (e.g., 0 to 1) to make it easier to compare.

4. **Handling Outliers**
   - **Detection**: Identify outliers using statistical methods such as Z-scores, IQR (Interquartile Range), or visualization techniques like box plots.
   - **Treatment**:
     - **Remove**: Delete outliers if they are errors.
     - **Cap**: Set a threshold and cap values above or below this threshold.
     - **Transform**: Apply transformations (e.g., log, square root) to reduce the impact of outliers.

5. **Data Type Conversion**
   - Ensure that data is in the correct format (e.g., converting strings to dates, integers to floats).

6. **Removing Noise**
   - **Smoothing**: Apply techniques like moving averages to reduce noise in time-series data.
   - **Filtering**: Use filters to remove unwanted data points.

7. **Data Validation**
   - **Range Checks**: Ensure data falls within a specified range.

## <mark> 4) What are outliers? Discuss the methods adopted for outlier detection. </mark>

### What are Outliers?

Outliers are data points that are significantly different from the majority of the data in a dataset. They can be unusually high or low values that deviate from the expected range of values. Outliers can occur due to various reasons, such as measurement errors, data entry errors, or natural variability in the data. Detecting and handling outliers is crucial because they can have a significant impact on statistical analyses and machine learning models.

### Methods for Outlier Detection

There are several methods for detecting outliers, ranging from simple statistical techniques to more advanced machine learning algorithms. Here are some commonly used methods:

#### 1. **Statistical Methods**

1. **Z-Score**
   - **Description**: The Z-score measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean. A high Z-score indicates that the data point is far from the mean.
   - **Formula**: \( Z = \frac{(X - \mu)}{\sigma} \)
     - \( X \) is the data point.
     - \( \mu \) is the mean of the dataset.
     - \( \sigma \) is the standard deviation of the dataset.
   - **Threshold**: Typically, a Z-score greater than 3 or less than -3 is considered an outlier.
   - **Pros**: Simple and easy to implement.
   - **Cons**: Assumes the data is normally distributed.

2. **Interquartile Range (IQR)**
   - **Description**: The IQR is the range between the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3). Data points that fall below Q1 - 1.5 * IQR or above Q3 + 1.5 * IQR are considered outliers.
   - **Formula**:
     - \( Q1 \) is the 25th percentile.
     - \( Q3 \) is the 75th percentile.
     - \( IQR = Q3 - Q1 \)
   - **Threshold**: Data points outside the range [Q1 - 1.5 * IQR, Q3 + 1.5 * IQR] are outliers.
   - **Pros**: More robust to outliers compared to Z-score.
   - **Cons**: Less sensitive to extreme values.

3. **Box Plots**
   - **Description**: A box plot visualizes the distribution of data and identifies outliers based on the IQR method.
   - **Visualization**: Data points outside the whiskers (Q1 - 1.5 * IQR and Q3 + 1.5 * IQR) are plotted as individual points and considered outliers.
   - **Pros**: Intuitive and easy to interpret.
   - **Cons**: Subjective interpretation.

#### 2. **Machine Learning Methods**

1. **Isolation Forest**
   - **Description**: An unsupervised learning algorithm that isolates anomalies by randomly selecting a feature and splitting it. Anomalies are easier to isolate and thus have shorter paths in the tree.
   - **Pros**: Effective for high-dimensional data and does not assume any underlying distribution.
   - **Cons**: Can be computationally expensive and requires tuning of hyperparameters.

2. **One-Class SVM**
   - **Description**: An unsupervised learning algorithm that learns the decision boundary around the normal data points. Data points outside this boundary are considered outliers.
   - **Pros**: Effective for anomaly detection and does not require labeled data.
   - **Cons**: Can be sensitive to hyperparameters and requires careful tuning.

3. **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**
   - **Description**: A clustering algorithm that groups data points into clusters based on density. Points that do not belong to any cluster are considered outliers.
   - **Pros**: Can identify clusters of arbitrary shapes and is robust to outliers.
   - **Cons**: Requires tuning of parameters like epsilon and min_samples.

4. **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)**
   - **Description**: Measures the local deviation of density of a given data point with respect to its neighbors. Data points with a significantly higher LOF are considered outliers.
   - **Pros**: Effective for detecting outliers in dense datasets.
   - **Cons**: Can be computationally expensive for large datasets.

#### 3. **Visualization Techniques**

1. **Scatter Plots**
   - **Description**: Plot data points on a graph to visually identify outliers.
   - **Pros**: Intuitive and easy to interpret.
   - **Cons**: Can be time-consuming for large datasets.

2. **Histograms**
   - **Description**: Visualize the distribution of data to identify data points that fall outside the expected range.
   - **Pros**: Simple and easy to understand.
   - **Cons**: Less precise for identifying specific outliers.

### Summary

- **Outliers**: Data points that are significantly different from the majority of the data. They can be caused by measurement errors, data entry errors, or natural variability.
- **Detection Methods**:
  - **Statistical Methods**: Z-score and IQR are simple and effective for detecting outliers in normally distributed data.
  - **Machine Learning Methods**: Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, DBSCAN, and LOF are more advanced techniques that can handle high-dimensional data and do not assume any underlying distribution.
  - **Visualization Techniques**: Box plots, scatter plots, and histograms provide intuitive ways to identify outliers visually.

By using these methods, you can effectively detect outliers in your dataset and decide on the appropriate action to take, whether it's removing them, transforming them, or investigating them further.

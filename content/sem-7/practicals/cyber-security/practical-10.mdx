## Aim: Study and Audit of Indus University IT Infrastructure

### 1. Define Audit Scope & Permissions

- **Scope:**
    - Audit is limited to Indus University's internal network, servers, workstations, Wi-Fi systems, and security infrastructure.
    - Includes campus Wi-Fi, computer labs, faculty systems, and primary university servers.
    - Does not include student personal devices or off-campus systems.
- **Permissions:**
    - Authorized by university IT admin team.
    - Read-only access to system configurations and scan reports.
    - No intrusive testing (e.g., no exploitation or DoS attacks).
    - All audits conducted during non-peak hours to avoid disruption.

### List of Systems and Networks to be Audited

|Category|System/Device|
|---|---|
|**Servers**|Web servers, DB servers, File servers|
|**Workstations**|Faculty PCs, Lab PCs|
|**Networking Devices**|Switches, Routers, Firewalls|
|**Wireless Networks**|Campus Wi-Fi access points|
|**Endpoints**|Student lab machines, Admin systems|
|**Security Tools**|Antivirus, Endpoint Detection Systems|

### 2. Identify Permitted Tests

- **Allowed:**
    - Port scanning and service enumeration (using Nmap).
    - Vulnerability scanning (using OpenVAS or Nessus).
    - Endpoint security checks.
    - Configuration checks.
    - Passive monitoring and log inspection.
- **Not Allowed:**
    - Exploitation of vulnerabilities.
    - Denial-of-service (DoS) tests.
    - Modifying system configurations.

### Network Scanning & Mapping

- **Tools Used:** Nmap
- **Findings:**
    - Identified live hosts in internal subnet 192.168.29.0/24.
    - Open ports: 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), 3306 (MySQL).
    - Services: Apache web server, MySQL database, Remote Desktop (RDP).

### Vulnerability Assessment

- **Tools Used:** OpenVAS
- **Targets:**
    - University Web Server: web.indusuniv.edu.
    - Lab PC IP: 192.168.29.105.
- **Results:**
    - Web Server: Apache 2.4.49 (vulnerable to CVE-2021-41773).
    - MySQL on lab machine not configured with secure root password.
    - Suggest applying latest security patches.

### Endpoint Security Check

|Parameter|Observation|
|---|---|
|**Antivirus**|Installed on most faculty PCs; lab PCs outdated.|
|**Firewall**|Enabled on all systems, default rules applied.|
|**OS Updates**|Some lab systems running Win|

### Wi-Fi Security Testing

- **SSID Security:** WPA2 enabled.
- **MAC Filtering:** Not configured.
- **Password Strength:** Weak, commonly shared among students.
- **Captive Portal:** Not enabled.
- **Recommendations:**
    - Enforce stronger Wi-Fi passphrases.
    - Enable guest network isolation.
    - Add MAC based device filtering.

### Backup and Recovery Review

- **Server Backup:**
    - Weekly automatic backup configured on DB server.
    - No cloud backup present.
- **Lab PCs:**
    - No data backup implemented.
- **Recommendations:**
    - Implement daily incremental + weekly full backups.
    - Store backup copies in secure off-site or cloud storage.

### Logging and Monitoring

- **Current Setup:**
    - Web server logs enabled (Apache access/error).
    - No centralized logging for endpoints or firewall.
- **Recommendations:**
    - Deploy centralized log management (e.g., ELK stack).
    - Monitor for login attempts, malware detections, policy violations.

### Final Report Summary

|Audit Area|Status|Recommendations|
|---|---|---|
|Network Security|Moderate|Patch services, limit open ports.|
|Vulnerability Management|Weak|Regular scans, update vulnerable software.|
|Endpoint Security|Moderate|Enforce updates, stronger passwords.|
|Wi-Fi Security|Weak|Change passwords, enable MAC filtering.|
|Backup & Recovery|Poor|Automate backup system.|
|Logging|Basic|Centralize and actively monitor.|

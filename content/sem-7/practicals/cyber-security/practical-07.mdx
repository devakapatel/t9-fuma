## Aim: Write a program to sniff packets sent over a network.

### Introduction to Packet Sniffing

Packet sniffing (a.k.a. wire-tapping) is the act of intercepting and logging every packet that flows across a network segment. By forcing a Network-Interface Card (NIC) into promiscuous mode, the host receives frames regardless of the MAC address they were destined for.

### Python Simulation Code: Harmless "Fork Bomb" Behavior

`# Simulated harmless virus behavior - for educational purposes ONLY # WARNING: This script is safe but annoying – opens multiple windows. # Run in a sandboxed or virtual environment only. import os import time import subprocess def harmless_simulation():     print("Starting harmless simulation...")     for i in range(5): # Limit the loop for safety         subprocess.Popen(['notepad.exe']) # On Windows         # For Linux use: subprocess.Popen(['gedit'])         print(f"[{i+1}] Dummy window opened.")         time.sleep(1) if __name__ == "__main__":     harmless_simulation()`

### Analysis of Behavior

|Behavior|Description|
|---|---|
|**Window spawning**|Simulates DoS-like effect by opening multiple apps.|
|**Resource usage**|Shows how malware consumes system resources.|
|**No damage**|No files are deleted or modified.|

### Types of Malware

|Type|Effect|
|---|---|
|**Worm**|Spreads across networks.|
|**Trojan**|Disguises as legitimate software.|
|**Ransomware**|Encrypts files and demands payment.|
|**Spyware**|Collects user data secretly.|
|**Adware**|Displays unwanted ads.|

### Tools for Safe Malware Testing

|Tool|Use|
|---|---|
|**Cuckoo Sandbox**|Malware analysis.|
|**Remnux VM**|Reverse engineering.|
|**Any.run**|Online sandbox environment.|

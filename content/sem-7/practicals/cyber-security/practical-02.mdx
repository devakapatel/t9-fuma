## **Aim:** Port scanning using Nmap

### **What is Port Scanning?**
Process of probing a host to determine **open/closed/filtered ports**. Used for:
- Network diagnostics
- Security assessments
- Attack reconnaissance

---

### **6 Port States Recognized by Nmap**

| State            | Meaning |
|------------------|--------|
| **Open**         | Application accepting connections |
| **Closed**       | Port accessible, no service listening |
| **Filtered**     | Firewall/filter blocking probe |
| **Unfiltered**   | Port accessible, but state undetermined (e.g., ACK scan) |
| **Open\|Filtered**| Nmap can't tell (common in UDP/FIN scans) |
| **Closed\|Filtered** | Ambiguous (e.g., idle scan) |

### **Port Scan Commands**

```bash
nmap [TARGET]                    # Default 1000 ports
nmap -p 80,443 [TARGET]          # Specific ports
nmap -p- [TARGET]                # All 65535 ports
nmap -A [TARGET]                 # Aggressive
nmap -sV [TARGET]                # Version detection
nmap -sS [TARGET]                # SYN (stealth)
nmap -sU [TARGET]                # UDP
nmap 192.168.1.1-50              # IP range
nmap 192.168.1.0/24              # Subnet
```

## AIM: Sketch out and analyze the architecture of Microsoft Azure.

## THEORY:

### 9A. What is Microsoft Azure?

Microsoft Azure, often referred to as Azure, is a cloud computing platform run by Microsoft , which offers access, management, and development of applications and services through global data centers. It provides a range of capabilities, including software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). Microsoft Azure supports many programming languages, tools, and frameworks, including Microsoft-specific and third-party software and systems.

### 9B. Azure Architecture

An Azure architecture diagram visualizes the deployment and hosting of any application on Azure cloud services.
- Azure architecture is the most popular cloud service used by most of the 500 fortune companies.
- Organizations use Azure architectures because it is cost-effective, quick, and flexible.
- An Azure diagram provides a better understanding of your cloud infrastructure by depicting your organization's network topologies and databases.
- Azure diagrams depict the cloud computing services of an enterprise.
- Making these diagrams is essential if you plan to use Azure architecture services.

### 9C. Working of Microsoft Azure.

- Microsoft offers through the Azure portal, a number of third-party vendors also make software directly available through Azure.
- The cost billed for third-party applications varies widely but may involve paying a subscription fee for the application, plus a usage fee for the infrastructure used to host the application.
- Microsoft provides the following five different customer support options for Azure:
  - Basic
  - Developer
  - Standard
  - Professional Direct
  - Enterprise (Premier)
- These customer support plans vary in terms of scope and price.
- Basic support is available to all Azure accounts , but Microsoft charges a fee for the other support offerings.
- Developer support costs $29 per month , while Standard support costs $100 per month and Professional Direct support is $1,000 per month.

### 9D. Creation of Azure Architecture diagram (Using EdrawMax Online).

- STEP 1: Log in to EdrawMax Online or create a new account.
- STEP 2: You can make your diagram using a template or open a blank canvas to draw it from scratch. Go to new, and click on the cloud service category. Select azure and click on the "+" button to get a new canvas, or select a template to edit it right away.
- STEP 3: The next step is to customize your azure architecture diagram. Go to the symbols library and insert icons and symbols with a simple drag and drop. Add connectors to visualize the relationship between components. Align your diagram, adjust the layout, and style it by changing fonts. Customize it using drawing tools, auto themes, and color fill.
- STEP 4: After your diagram is complete, the next step is to download it. Edraw Max Online supports various document formats, so you can export in any format you want. You can also share and print it.
